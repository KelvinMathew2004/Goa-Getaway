# 🏖️ Goa Trip Project

This is a simple interactive modal project built for the **CodePath WEB101** course. The modal displays a trip confirmation with animation, custom styling, and JavaScript-driven interactions.

## 📚 Overview

The project simulates a trip confirmation popup modal for a fictional Goa trip. It features:
- A full-screen modal with trip information
- A close (`×`) button to dismiss the modal
- An animated character image that moves across the screen and flips direction
- Timed styling updates using JavaScript

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox and keyframe animations)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling, `setTimeout`)

## 🚀 Features

- Modal with styled layout and content (`Trip Status`, `Message`, etc.)
- Close button (`<span>`) to dismiss the modal
- Timed actions like background color change after a few seconds
- Animation of an image that walks across the screen and flips direction when reaching the end
- Uses semantic HTML and clean structure

## 🎯 Key JavaScript Concepts Used

- `document.getElementById()`
- `addEventListener("click", ...)`
- `style.display`, `style.backgroundColor`, `style.transform`
- CSS animations triggered via `@keyframes`
- `setInterval()` and `setTimeout()` for timed events

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone or download the project
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Interact with the modal popup, animation, and close button
4. Watch for automatic background color changes or timed effects

## 📸 Example Use Case

- Show trip confirmations in a fun and visual way
- Practice DOM manipulation, animations, and modals
- Great intro project for understanding dynamic web interfaces
